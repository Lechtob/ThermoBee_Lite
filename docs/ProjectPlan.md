# ThermoBee Lite Project Plan

## Introduction

**ThermoBee Lite** is a compact, energy-efficient ZigBee sensor designed to monitor temperature, humidity, air quality, and battery level. The device aims to be compatible with Home Assistant and provide at least 6 months of battery life on a single battery.

## Objectives

- Develop a fully functional ZigBee sensor device.
- Achieve at least 6 months of battery life.
- Ensure seamless integration with Home Assistant.
- Design a compact and aesthetically pleasing enclosure.
- Release the project as open-source for community collaboration.

## Scope

- **Hardware Development**:
  - Select appropriate components (microcontroller, sensors, power management).
  - Design schematics and PCB layout.
  - Prototype and test hardware components.

- **Firmware Development**:
  - Develop firmware for sensor readings and ZigBee communication.
  - Implement power-saving features to extend battery life.
  - Ensure reliable data transmission to the ZigBee coordinator.

- **Enclosure Design**:
  - Create a compact enclosure suitable for home environments.
  - Design for ease of assembly and maintenance.
  - Provide 3D models for community use.

- **Documentation**:
  - Provide comprehensive documentation for assembly, usage, and contributions.
  - Maintain project planning and requirements documents.
  - Update user manuals and guides.
